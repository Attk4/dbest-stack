# DBEST stack

The `DBEST` (DrizzleORM, Bun, ElysiaJS, SolidStart, Tailwind CSS) stack is a bun-based ðŸ”¥ `BLAZINGLY FAST` ðŸ”¥ full-stack `100% type-safe` web development solution that provides `everything` you need to build a `production-ready` web app based on the performant and scalable SolidStart meta-framework. It consists of:

- [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com)
- [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Creating a project

Create a new project

```bash
bun create itsyoboieltr/dbest-stack
```

Optionally specify a name for the destination folder. If no destination is specified, the name `dbest-stack` will be used.

```bash
bun create itsyoboieltr/dbest-stack my-app
```

Bun will perform the following steps:

- Download the `template`
- Copy all template files into the `destination folder`
- Install dependencies with `bun i`.
- Initialize a fresh Git repo. Opt out with the `--no-git` flag.

## Getting started

Once the project is created and the dependencies are installed, the environment variables need to be set up. The following environment variables are required for the project to run:

[.env.example](.env.example)

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:adminadmin@0.0.0.0:5432/db
VITE_HOST_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

If your database schema does not match the schema defined by drizzle, then the database needs to be synchronized. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
bun push
```

In addition, drizzle studio can be leveraged to connect to the database and browse, add, delete and update data based on the declared drizzle schema.

```bash
bun studio
```

## Developing

If everything is set up correctly, you can start the development server with:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Building

Build for production by running the following command:

```bash
bun run build
```

## Running

Run in production by running the following command:

```bash
bun start
```
